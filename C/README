README

Compile code only once, by navigating to C folder in terminal and then typing: make

To simulate new parameters for fixed point, go to the simparams folder and see how Viterbi_4_10 is written

Running ./main in the C folder will simulate all the files in the simparams folder

Results are placed in the results folder, with the same filename as the simulation file

to plot any result file, go to the results folder in terminal and type python plot.py [files_to_plot]
eg: $ python plot.py ./MLE ./Viterbi ./Viterbi_4_10

So far the Q4.10 format for fixed point looks good, maybe you can experiment with different formats and see what the plots look like, just so that we have a spread to show in our progress report. I haven't tried any other formats. I've included a helpful lecture on fixed point where it outlines what the Qn.m format stands for.

Okay thanks bye.
